# Welcome â€” I'm Mark Johnson

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a computational mathematician (PhD, Princeton) and technology executive exploring the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence â€” with a focus on ethics, privacy, and the full computational stack from theory to deployment.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Current Focus

I'm independently researching the frontiers of AI through 2025, applying ideas from my PhD in dynamical systems to modern machine learning, while also diving into:

- Algorithmic transparency and responsible deployment
- Mathematical foundations of AI (stability, structure, invariants)
- Practical and ethical data practices
- Conversations with business leaders on real-world AI impact

This is a space to share code, tools, models, and mathematical insights â€” some rooted in old Fortran, some in new PyTorch.

## ðŸ§­ What's Next

By early 2026, I'm aiming to take on a leadership role at a cutting-edge AI company â€” bringing together decades of experience in data, systems, and people with a clear-eyed view of where this technology is heading.
